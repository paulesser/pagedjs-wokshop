        ><span class="smcap">Walt Whitman</span> has somewhere a fine and just distinction
        between ‚Äúloving by allowance‚Äù and ‚Äúloving with personal love.‚Äù This distinction
        applies to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
        numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it brings a
        curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as to their best work
        than in the case of those others who are loved ‚Äúby allowance‚Äù by convention, and
        because it is felt to be the right and proper thing to love them. And in the
        sect‚Äîfairly large and yet unusually choice‚Äîof Austenians or Janites, there would
        probably be found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the
        novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of</i

      Northanger Abbey, <i>its completeness, finish, and</i> entrain,
      <i

      Persuasion,

      Mansfield Park
      <i
        >is admittedly theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has
        almost wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that Edmund
        only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might very likely have
        taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous; yet the matchless
        rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and others have secured, I
        believe, a considerable party for it.</i

        though not her most peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss
        Bates, as the Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other
        hand, I, for my part, declare for</i
      >
      Pride and Prejudice
      <i
        >unhesitatingly. It seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the
        most eminently quintessential of its author‚Äôs works; and for this contention in
        such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show cause.</i
      ></p

    <p
      ><i
        >In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the reader)
        was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796, when Miss Austen
        was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and finished at Chawton some fifteen
        years later, and was not published till 1813, only four years before her death. I
        do not know whether, in this combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of
        youth, and the critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct
        superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it possesses over
        all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost regular enough for
        Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident could be retrenched without loss
        to the story. The elopement of Lydia and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and
        Mrs. Rushworth, a</i
      >
      coup de th√©√¢tre;
      <i
        >it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the story earlier, and
        brings about the denouement with complete propriety. All the minor passages‚Äîthe
        loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr. Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the
        Derbyshire tour‚Äîfit in after the same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There
        is no attempt at the hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions
        between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the
        intrigue of</i
      >
      Emma,
      <i
        >but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think the best feature of that
        otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen always liked something of the
        misunderstanding kind, which afforded her opportunities for the display of the
        peculiar and incomparable talent to be noticed presently, she has been satisfied
        here with the perfectly natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy‚Äôs
        conduct given by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness)
        from the gradual transformation of Elizabeth‚Äôs own feelings from positive aversion
        to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of the playwright has
        ever been laid upon</i
      >
      Pride and Prejudice;
      <i
        >and I dare say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or
        garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and delicate for
        pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would certainly not be hampered
        by any of those loosenesses of construction, which, sometimes disguised by the
        conveniences of which the novelist can avail himself, appear at once on the
        stage.</i
      ></p
    >

    <p
      ><i
        >I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to more than
        one school of critics, that construction is not the highest merit, the choicest
        gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts and graces most advantageously
        to the critical eye; and the want of it will sometimes mar those
        graces‚Äîappreciably, though not quite consciously‚Äîto eyes by no means
        ultra-critical. But a very badly-built novel which excelled in pathetic or
        humorous character, or which displayed consummate command of dialogue‚Äîperhaps the
        rarest of all faculties‚Äîwould be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot
        acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the ability
        which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one should put</i
      >
      Pride and Prejudice
      <i
        >far lower if it did not contain what seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss
        Austen‚Äôs humour and of her faculty of character-creation‚Äîmasterpieces who may
        indeed admit John Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their
        company, but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still
        superior to them.</i
      ></p
    >

    <p
      ><i
        >The characteristics of Miss Austen‚Äôs humour are so subtle and delicate that they
        are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to express, and at any
        particular time likely to be differently apprehended by different persons. To me
        this humour seems to possess a greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison
        than to any other of the numerous species of this great British genus. The
        differences of scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of
        course, obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,
        for there was a distinctly feminine element in ‚ÄúMr. Spectator,‚Äù and in Jane
        Austen‚Äôs genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was masculine. But
        the likeness of quality consists in a great number of common subdivisions of
        quality‚Äîdemureness, extreme minuteness of touch, avoidance of loud tones and
        glaring effects. Also there is in both a certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty.
        It is the custom with those who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of
        Addison with the savagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the
        boisterousness of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes
        that her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much protest.
        Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a restrained and
        well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in roasting and cutting up a
        fool. A man in the early eighteenth century, of course, could push this taste
        further than a lady in the early nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen‚Äôs
        principles, as well as her heart, would have shrunk from such things as the letter
        from the unfortunate husband in the</i
      >
      Spectator,
      <i
        >who describes, with all the gusto and all the innocence in the world, how his
        wife and his friend induce him to play at blind-man‚Äôs-buff. But another</i
      >
      Spectator
      <i
        >letter‚Äîthat of the damsel of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and
        assures her selected Mentor that ‚Äúhe admires your</i
      >
      Spectators
      <i
        >mightily‚Äù‚Äîmight have been written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia
        Bennet in the days of Lydia‚Äôs great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I
        think unreasonably) have found ‚Äúcynicism‚Äù in touches of Miss Austen‚Äôs own, such as
        her satire of Mrs. Musgrove‚Äôs self-deceiving regrets over her son. But this word
        ‚Äúcynical‚Äù is one of the most misused in the English language, especially when, by
        a glaring and gratuitous falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not
        to rough and snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism
        means the perception of ‚Äúthe other side,‚Äù the sense of ‚Äúthe accepted hells
        beneath,‚Äù the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and that to seem
        is not identical with to be‚Äîif this be cynicism, then every man and woman who is
        not a fool, who does not care to live in a fool‚Äôs paradise, who has knowledge of
        nature and the world and life, is a cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly
        was one. She may even have been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr.
        Bennet, she took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at
        work her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight, and I do
        not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she was immensely the
        better for it as an artist.</i

    <p
      ><i
        >In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed that
        ‚Äúmetaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it, combined with the
        narrowness of her field;‚Äù and he has justly added that we need not go beyond her
        own comparison to the art of a miniature painter. To make this latter observation
        quite exact we must not use the term miniature in its restricted sense, and must
        think rather of Memling at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at
        the other, than of Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I
        should myself use the word ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù in connection with her. If her world is a
        microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the littleness. She
        does not touch what she did not feel herself called to paint; I am not so sure
        that she could not have painted what she did not feel herself called to touch. It
        is at least remarkable that in two very short periods of writing‚Äîone of about
        three years, and another of not much more than five‚Äîshe executed six capital
        works, and has not left a single failure. It is possible that the romantic paste
        in her composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly anybody born
        in her decade‚Äîthat of the eighteenth-century seventies‚Äîindependently exhibited the
        full romantic quality. Even Scott required hill and mountain and ballad, even
        Coleridge metaphysics and German to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss
        Austen was an English girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when
        ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might pierce
        their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the gravest fears, when
        their studies, their ways, their conduct were subject to all those fantastic
        limits and restrictions against which Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better
        general sense than particular taste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when
        the white frost touched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good
        journey even in a black one.</i

    <p
      ><i
        >For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which only genius
        knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the first head she could
        not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are true, and her women are, in the
        old sense, ‚Äúabsolute.‚Äù As to art, if she has never tried idealism, her realism is
        real to a degree which makes the false realism of our own day look merely
        dead-alive. Take almost any Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch
        him laboriously piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You
        get none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can shape
        a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the myriad, trivial,
        unforced strokes build up the picture like magic. Nothing is false; nothing is
        superfluous. When (to take the present book only) Mr. Collins changed his mind
        from Jane to Elizabeth ‚Äúwhile Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire‚Äù (and we know</i
      >
      how
      <i
        >Mrs. Bennet would have stirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy ‚Äúbrought his coffee-cup
        back</i
      >
      himself,‚Äù
      <i
        >the touch in each case is like that of Swift‚Äî‚Äútaller by the breadth of my
        nail‚Äù‚Äîwhich impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with just and outspoken
        admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I should put Miss Austen as near to
        Swift in some ways, as I have put her to Addison in others.</i
      ></p
    >

    <p
      ><i
        >This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears nowhere else in
        the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins is really</i
      >
      great;
      <i
        >far greater than anything Addison ever did, almost great enough for Fielding or
        for Swift himself. It has been said that no one ever was like him. But in the
        first place,</i
      >
      he
      <i
        >was like him; he is there‚Äîalive, imperishable, more real than hundreds of prime
        ministers and archbishops, of ‚Äúmetals, semi-metals, and distinguished
        philosophers.‚Äù In the second place, it is rash, I think, to conclude that an
        actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at the end of the eighteenth
        century. It is very interesting that we possess, in this same gallery, what may be
        called a spoiled first draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood.
        The formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait is
        only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr. Collins is
        perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the ‚Äúminiature,‚Äù there is
        something gigantic in the way in which a certain side, and more than one, of
        humanity, and especially eighteenth-century humanity, its Philistinism, its
        well-meaning but hide-bound morality, its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect
        for rank, its materialism, its selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit
        that one speech or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being
        reconciled with reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and
        actions are historically true.</i
      ></p
    >

    <p
      ><i
        >But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily exhibited
        if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the figures of Mr. Bennet and
        of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like Mr. Collins himself, has been
        charged with exaggeration. There is, perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the
        charge; but it seems to me very faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it
        would be impossible to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of
        noble birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners, as
        Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl‚Äôs daughter, the Lady Powerful (if not
        exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish, rich, long out of marital
        authority, and so forth, had opportunities of developing these agreeable
        characteristics which seldom present themselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss
        Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even Miss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to
        think, rather hard on him for the ‚Äúimpropriety‚Äù of his conduct. His wife was
        evidently, and must always have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he
        had shot her or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit
        but the ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach, except for
        an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of the elopement, and
        his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the consciously humorous kind‚Äîin
        the kind that we laugh with, not at‚Äîthat even Miss Austen has put into the mouth
        of any of her characters. It is difficult to know whether he is most agreeable
        when talking to his wife, or when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the
        general sense of the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank
        his consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, ‚ÄúMy dear, do not
        give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter
        ourselves that</i
      >
      I
      <i
        >may be the survivor;‚Äù and his inquiry to his colossal cousin as to the
        compliments which Mr. Collins has just related as made by himself to Lady
        Catherine, ‚ÄúMay I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse
        of the moment, or are the result of previous study?‚Äù These are the things which
        give Miss Austen‚Äôs readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are
        felt by the readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as
        they are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction outside of
        these four.</i

    <p
      ><i>The goodness of the minor characters in</i> Pride and Prejudice
      <i
        >has been already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties
        difficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have glanced at,
        and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly
        true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and Lydia; but it is not every author,
        even of genius, who would have differentiated with such unerring skill the effects
        of folly and vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common
        weaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has taken
        rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her; not merely in the
        text, but, as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which Mr.
        Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming her privately to marry ‚Äúone of Mr. Philips‚Äôs
        clerks.‚Äù The habits of first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of
        playing and singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but
        perhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings in that
        Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not to extend to her a
        share of the respect and affection (affection and respect of a peculiar kind;
        doubtless), with which one regards Mr. Collins, when she draws the moral of
        Lydia‚Äôs fall. I sometimes wish that the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss
        Austen to unite these personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and
        soothe poor Mrs. Bennet‚Äôs anguish over the entail.</i

        little on the thither side of the line between comedy and farce) is a wonderfully
        clever study in drab of one kind, and that Wickham (though something of Miss
        Austen‚Äôs hesitation of touch in dealing with young men appears) is a not much less
        notable sketch in drab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she
        is, yet not disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with a
        cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the hero and the
        heroine are not tints to be dismissed.</i

        slight and simple that it hardly enters into comparison. It has sometimes, I
        believe, been urged that his pride is unnatural at first in its expression and
        later in its yielding, while his falling in love at all is not extremely probable.
        Here again I cannot go with the objectors. Darcy‚Äôs own account of the way in which
        his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and nothing
        could be, psychologically speaking, a</i

        rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come husband-hunting. His being neither
        is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common
        sense, but not really injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his
        being in love, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that
        phenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state, only she has
        of course not counted in what was due to her own personal charm.</i

        >The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen herself
        downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather to be felt than to
        be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the</i
      >
      allegro <i>or</i> allegra
      <i
        >division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was always provokingly chary of
        description in regard to her beauties; and except the fine eyes, and a hint or two
        that she had at any rate sometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we
        hear nothing about her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the
        lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever‚Äîalmost
        strong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word‚Äîand secondly in her
        being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her propensity to tease and the
        sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give at least as good as she gets when she
        is attacked; but she never ‚Äúscratches,‚Äù and she never attacks first. Some of the
        merest obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early speeches a
        slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to serious business, as
        in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is, as it should be, the climax of
        the interest of the book), and in the final ladies‚Äô battle with Lady Catherine,
        she is unexceptionable. Then too she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not
        disguise from herself or anybody that she resents Darcy‚Äôs first ill-mannered
        personality with as personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the
        ill-manners of this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the
        same kind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have been
        heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons who ought to
        have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the injury done to Jane and the
        contempt shown to the rest of her family aggravate this resentment in the
        healthiest way in the world.</i

    <p
      ><i
        >Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a common form
        of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her playfulness, her wit,
        her affectionate and natural disposition, of a certain fearlessness very uncommon
        in heroines of her type and age. Nearly all of them would have been in speechless
        awe of the magnificent Darcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and
        fluttered at the idea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating
        Wickham. Elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing</i
      >
      viraginous,
      <i
        >nothing of the ‚ÄúNew Woman‚Äù about her, has by nature what the best modern (not
        ‚Äúnew‚Äù) women have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea
        that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with her if
        they can. Though not in the least ‚Äúimpudent and mannish grown,‚Äù she has no mere
        sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of passion common and likely to
        seem natural in Miss Austen‚Äôs day was so invariably connected with the display of
        one or the other, or both of these qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth
        outwardly passionate. But I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would
        have married Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and anybody who
        can read between lines will not find the lovers‚Äô conversations in the final
        chapters so frigid as they might have looked to the Della Cruscans of their own
        day, and perhaps do look to the Della Cruscans of this.</i

    <p
      ><i
        >And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of charm?‚Äîit is there.
        There were better sense in the sad mechanic exercise of determining the reason of
        its absence where it is not. In the novels of the last hundred years there are
        vast numbers of young ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love;
        there are at least five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit
        can help doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth Bennet,
        Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara Grant. I should have
        been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I should, I think, for mere
        occasional companionship, have preferred Diana and Barbara. But to live with and
        to marry, I do not know that any one of the four can come into competition with
        Elizabeth.</i

      man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a

      with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and
      some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.‚Äù</p

    <p>‚ÄúIs he married or single?‚Äù</p>

    <p
      >‚ÄúOh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five
      thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!‚Äù</p

    <p

    <p>‚ÄúIs that his design in settling here?‚Äù</p>

    <p
      >‚ÄúDesign? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he

    <p
      >‚ÄúI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go‚Äîor you may send them by
      themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of
      them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.‚Äù</p
    >

    <p
      >‚ÄúMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly <i>have</i> had my share of beauty, but I do
      not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up
      daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.‚Äù</p

    <p>‚ÄúIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.‚Äù</p>

      be impossible for <i>us</i> to visit him, if you do not.‚Äù</p

    <p
      >‚ÄúYou are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see
      you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his
